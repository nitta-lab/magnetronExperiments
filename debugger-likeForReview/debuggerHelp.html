<h1>How to operate the debugger-like view</h1>

<p>
With respect to the real-world programs, we extract only the source code related to each subject.
    The extracted source code of a real-world program is presented on the website in a Eclipseâ€™s debugger-like view.
    The debugger-like view allows the participants to control the program execution flow stepping through the source code. <br>
    First, press the debug button to start debugging.
    </p>

    <li>Press the third button from the left to step into the next line in the same method, </li>
    <li>Press the rightmost button to step return to the calling method.</li>
    </ul>
    Note that the website's back button may not work properly on the debugger-like view.
